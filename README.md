### Binary Game
Given an array of integers of ones and zeroes, return the first position and the length of the longest consecutive zeroes sequence.
### Example 1
```c
{
Input  : binaryArray [10] = {1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}
Output : "largest squence of zero has 8 zeros and it stars from index i = 2"
binaryArray has only ones and zeroes elements. 

        }
}
```

### Example 2
```c
{
Input  : binaryArray [10] = {1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0}
Output : "largest squence of zero has 4 zeros and it stars from index i = 6"
binaryArray has only ones and zeroes elements. 

        }
}
```
